* Finish Modal styling
* Add tests (more intelligent tests for Select component)
* When re-selecting after a selection has been made, the input field should be reset and the user should be able to see their current selection from the options. 
* Refactor using ES7 class properties - allowing for bindings at method definition.
* Fix handleSearch() broken method. Options are now passed to Modal with id already set. This means we can highlight when an option is clicked and now we need to configure for when an option is submmited with enter key.
* Fix broken tests for Modal.
